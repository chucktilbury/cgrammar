# C GRAMMAR 

This is a collection of C grammars that I have collected from the web. The site that a file was downloaded from is shown in a comment in the file where possible. There is no copyright that I can find. 

I have collected these and posted them in my github because I refer to them sometimes. I may use them at some point to create a simple interpreter. I have weird hobbies.
