ANSI C Yacc grammar
In 1985, Jeff Lee published his Yacc grammar (which is accompanied by a matching Lex specification) for the April 30, 1985 draft 
version of the ANSI C standard.  Tom Stockfisch reposted it to net.sources in 1987; that original, as mentioned in the answer to 
question 17.25 of the comp.lang.c FAQ, can be ftp'ed from ftp.uu.net, file usenet/net.sources/ansi.c.grammar.Z.

Jutta Degener, 1995

I am now taking this grammar and adapting parts of it to work with my simple project.
